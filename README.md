Just download or pull the code from this repository to get started.

In order to launch this demo app on the emulator or device you need to follow the following 3 steps.  
1. Open the Android SDK (Go to applications and click on Eclipse.app)  
2. Import the project folder that you have just downloaded  
3. Select “CalabashTest” in the Package Explorer and click on the green “Run” button in the headerbar of Eclipse. A new window “Android Device Chooser” should open. In case you plugged in a device it should appear here. Select it and click OK. The demo app should launch on your device.

By the way: In case you don’t have an Android phone on hand, you can also create a new Android virtual device in the Android device chooser.
